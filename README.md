> An exploration of how phosphine ligand properties affect Pd-C photocleavage in T-shaped methylpalladium complexes.

### 🏠 [Homepage](https://github.com/pmwaddell/ligands-ML)

## Introduction

Please see the publication I coauthored ([10.1039/D3SC02588H](https://doi.org/10.1039/D3SC02588H), thanks to the RSC 
for making it open access) describing visible light-induced homolytic Pd-C bond cleavage in phosphine-ligated, T-shaped 
organopalladium complexes. This repo represents a computational exploration of the generality of this reactivity, and 
how phosphine ligand properties can impact the photophysical and photochemical characteristics of these complexes.

The exploration of phosphine chemical space in this project was facilitated by the 
[Kraken virtual library](https://descriptor-libraries.molssi.org/kraken/).
